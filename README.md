# Serverless Snowplow
A serverless Snowplow pipeline on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for ~â‚¬0.02/day.

This repository is a Terraform template to run a fully serverless snowplow pipeline based on Google Cloud Run and BigQuery.
This allows you to run Snowplow at a minimal cost, especially for smaller sites and blogs.

## Basic Setup
The basic idea is to run a serverless collector and all the other components on a schedule (e.g. three times a day). This allows you to scale
down to zero while allowing still run a near-realtime pipeline. 

The pipeline uses the following components
- Cloud Run Service for collecting hits 
- Pub/Sub for communication between components
- Cloud Run Job for enrichment
- Cloud Run Job for the BigQuery stream loader
- Cloud Run Jobs for creating, mutating the BigQuery table as well as repeating failed inserts.

## Cost
I've been running this setup for blog with ~15.000 visitors/month for 2 cents a day. If still have your GCP credits, you should be good 
for the next 30 years or so...

## To Do
- Seperate service accounts for seperate services
- Add workflows in combination with schedule
- Add Iglu resolver from GCS bucket
